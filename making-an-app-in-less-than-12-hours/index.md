On Friday June 2nd, I attended the #MobileMonday hackathon, which took place at Galvanize’s offices in NYC. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much: I didn’t prepare anything in particular for the event. On the other hand, there were reasons to explain my presence there; in particular, the workshops by the IBM crowd, scheduled for Friday and Saturday. The Loopback one ended up being tremendously good (and I must thank @joesepi for that one since it was great).

I headed back home on Friday with my expectations up, willing to do something on Saturday. That same night, during a conversation with my wife, I refloated an old idea of mine: an app to find the speakeasy bars in NYC. With their passwords, secret doors and hidden passages, speakeasies have always had that particular appeal, that ‘prohibition era’ resemblance that makes them exciting.

The idea of the app was pretty straightforward: make a list of bars, pin them on a map and introduce a fun/related factor. In my case, I thought of introducing riddles in order to get the access details. How to solve the riddle? Well, that's the fun part: users would actually have to take a picture of the solution.

## An arena for ideas

Saturday morning found me working on the first layout, using Sketch. However, and given the circumstances, I ended up switching to Fuse and directly doing everything there. I came across some minor complications along the way: for example, a real time preview in Fuse required both my phone and Mac to be in the same IP range - an uncontrollable factor in the offices where the hackathon took place. I ended up making a build to my phone each time I wanted to test something. Trust me, it wasn’t nearly as bad as it sounds, and by 9pm I was on my way home with a nearly finished app!

I was missing the image-solving bit, but having the bar listing and the locations felt very good, and I was thrilled to have something to show. Sunday noon meant examination rounds for each project. Although I didn't expect to win anything - and I didn’t - but the judges were very impressed with my little app. In the end, the selected projects that would end up going to the finals were truly incredible, and each one of them used the Watson services in very clever ways. 

Since the feedback was good, I decided to keep up with the speakeasy app. Next in my agenda is to finish the app and upload it to the Play Store, and then develop an iOS version adapting the look & feel. 

If you're thinking in assisting a hackathon and building mobile projects, I can't recommend Fuse enough. Yes, you’ll be needing a bit of practice to get the grip of it, but once you’re there it's super easy to start and to make something real in little time. And, as usual, please don’t hesitate to drop me a line if you need advice to kickstart a Fuse project - I’m all ears!
