On Friday June 2nd I went to the #MobileMonday Hackaton on the Galvanize offices in NYC. I wasn't expecting to do much because I didn't prepared anything, I don't even had an idea of something to make. The main reason was for the different workshops that people from IBM were going to give on Friday and Saturday, specifically for Loopback (thanks @joesepi for the course, it was great!)

I went home on Friday with more will to do something on Saturday and that night, talking with Diana I refloated an old idea of making an app to find the different speakeasy bar's in NYC. If you never went to a speakeasy, you should! These are bars that resemble the prohibition era, because you have to know your way in: sometimes is a password, sometimes a secret door inside a restaurant or a telephone cabin that you have to use to get in!

The idea of the app was to have a list of bars, locate them in a map and in order to see the access details you should solve a riddle. How you solve it? Well, that's the fun part, you actually have to take a picture of the solution.

I went on Saturday morning and I started with the first layout in Sketch, but because of time, I went directly to Fuse and made everything there directly. I had some complications because in order to have the real time preview in Fuse my phone and my Mac had to be in the same IP range and that wasn't possible to control with the Galvanize wifi. I ended up making a build to my phone each time I wanted to test something, but it wasn't too bad.

Around 9pm I went home with a nearly finished app! I couldn't implement the image solving part, but I ended up with the bar listing and the map location of each bar. I was very thrilled to have something to show! 

On Sunday noon the judge round started on each project. Although I didn't expected to win anything, the judges were very impressed with it. Finally, the projects that were elected to the finals were awesome! They used the Watson services in a very clever way.

I was so thrilled with what I achieved that I want to finish it soon and publish it on the Play Store. I want to develop an iOS version also, but I want first to change the look&feel to adapt it to the platform, it's important!

If you're thinking in assisting to a hackaton and build a mobile project, I can't recommend Fuse enough! Although you need to practice a little bit before, it's super easy to start and to make something real in so little time feels like magic.
