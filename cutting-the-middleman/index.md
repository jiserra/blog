title: Cutting the middleman
excerpt: How I got from just building prototypes to actually build applications.

When I first started designing interfaces for mobile applications, there wasn't any real tool for doing prototypes. Why we needed prototypes? It was clear that to test an application early in the design process, a user has to experiment with it. Also, it was very helpful to the developers to play with something the way it supposed to behave.

The closest thing that resembled a prototype was to export the different screens to PNG files and making an HTML page with links to go from one to the other. It served the purpose back then, but it was clear that as the profession evolved, we needed more tools.

After a while, the tools appeared. First, web based like Flinto (old version) and Invision, and more complex ones like Origami (it was born as a plugin for an old Mac tool). I started using those tools a bit frustrated by the limit of the web based ones and the complex of Origami, until Framer appeared: this changed everything for me!

With Framer I could make almost any animation and interaction I wanted. With the newly launched iOS 7 where skeuomorphism was left behind to make room for micro-interactions, this was a must.

There was however, a limitation I saw on this. The engineer developing for iOS (or Android when it became cool with Material Design) always has to **reinterpret** the prototype. This has the disadvantage that the quality of the animation/interaction is dependent on the ability of the engineer to correctly interpret the meticulous crafted movement created by the designer. Several animations libraries were built (Pop by Facebook was one of the firsts) to help develop this, but it wasn't enough.

I had the need not only to help the engineers developing apps but also a need to do something by myself. Until now, I owned 70% of the design process: the wireframes, the visual design, the UX and the prototypes. But it was clear at that point that I wanted to go further and have the ability to create the whole app by myself.

Since I was a little kid, I always programmed. First in QBasic with my 386 with a 16MHz CPU and when 2000's arrived, I started doing lot's of things in PHP. I understand logic and the different languages, but for some reason, Objective-C and Java were absolutely indigestible for me. I tried several times but fail miserably. Maybe, because it was so tied with design, the things I wanted to do were too difficult or required too much knowledge. Forget about Cordova also, I didn't wanted a nasty web app embedded in a web view, I wanted a real native app.

When I thought that I was never going to build a mobile application, I came across Fuse and immediately blew my mind. I was able to make something the way I wanted and with a language that I could easily understand. Sure, it was the first betas and it was a little bit green in some areas, but as a designer, it was something I always wanted.

I was amazed by how easy it was to create micro-interactions with all the level of detail I wanted. Also, because the UX language is very declarative on the visual styles, I could create complex components and use them easily in the rest of the app. Consuming data is also pretty easy: thanks to fetch I can use any JSON API and display the data just as I want. The online community is also great. Whenever I have a doubt, there's always someone on the Slack channel to help.

When I moved to NYC, one of the things I wanted is to talk and have meetings with people using Fuse. I soon discovered that it was going to be a bit difficult: there wasn't any meet up related to it. So I embarked in creating the first NYC Fuse Meetup and although I only organized two, the people that attended were very surprised about the possibilities of Fuse and what things you can do with it. (Stay tuned for the next one!)

As awesome as Framer is and how it advances with each release, we can't forget that is only a prototyping tool. Surely, we can connect external data sources and make very complex flows, but we can't publish that in a store. If you found that you want to go further and take control of the last step of a mobile app, don't hesitate in giving Fuse a spin, you won't regret it. And if you have any doubts or problem, just write me!
